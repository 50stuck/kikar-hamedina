The file we're using is html/newest.html.

This is a work in progress. We'll remove this folder when the design is completed and we merge it into the main project.

The designs are static. You can't load them from the server. Just open the html files in a web browser to see what they look like.


=========================================
Old stuff:

2 different designs:
- 1 for large screens: html/index.html (open in a large screen)
- 1 for mobile: html/mobile-first.html (make the screen small to see what it looks like on mobile)

Neither is properly responsive at the moment.
